# Paper Lily Dialogue Generator
Special thanks to Ransu-ll for their [OMORI dialogue generator](https://github.com/Ransu-ll/Omori-Dialogue-Generator), which this project is forked from. The code was simple enough to understand and I managed to get this done much quicker than if I started from scratch.

## Warning
***Contains spoilers for the game Paper Lily, do not proceed if you have not played
the game and want to avoid spoilers.***

## What is this?
This allows you to generate dialogue that is formatted the same way it is as in
game, allowing for easier generation of memes and other dialogue that was
*totally* said in game!

## How do I use it?
Head on over to the [website](https://azthemute.github.io/Paper-Lily-Dialogue-Generator/),
and then follow the instructions.
1. Select the desired settings
2. Edit the contents of each of the boxes
    * Character name is simple enough! Just click on it and edit it.
    * If you want a character's dialogue sprite to appear, enable the
      character checkbox and upload an image.
    * You can find images from online, the supporter pack, or from the game
      files if you know how.
    * Dialogue is a little harder, however! Ensure that you press enter if your
      dialogue takes up more than one line to allow it to render properly
      (unless you like squished text).
      You should also ensure that it takes no more than five lines (four if
      you have a name), otherwise it will not be rendered properly.
3. Press the "render" button
4. Get the image
    * Press the large download button that will appear, or right click and copy image to clipboard!
5. And you should be done!
