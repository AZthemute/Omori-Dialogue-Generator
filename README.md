# Omori Dialogue Generator

## Warning
***Contains spoilers for the game OMORI, do not proceed if you have not played
the game and want to avoid spoilers.***


## What is this?
This is a project that was inspired by a certain [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/rpl3p8/is_there_a_custom_dialogue_box_generator_anywhere/)
(sue me, it took me 4 months to finally whip up something presentable).

This allows you to generate dialogue that is formatted the same way it is as in
game, allowing for easier generation of memes and other dialogue that were
*totally* said in game!

## How do I use it?
Head on over to the [website](https://ransu-ll.github.io/Omori-Dialogue-Generator/),
and then follow the instructions (similar to instructions found on the website)
1. Select the desired settings
2. Edit the contents of each of the boxes
    * Character name is simple enough! Just click into it and edit!
    * Assuming portraits are enabled, just
      click into the box and a file prompt
      will open!  
      Any 106px by 106px image should do.
      [Download the images folder from this repository](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRansu-ll%2FOmori-Dialogue-Generator%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2FCharacter%2520Images)
    * Dialogue is a little harder, however! Ensure that you press enter if your
      dialogue takes up more than one line to allow it to render properly
      (unless you like squished text).
      You should also ensure that it takes no more than three lines, otherwise
      it will not be rendered properly.
3. Press the long "render" button
4. Get the image
    * Press the large download button that will appear, or
    * Right click and copy image to clipboard!
5. And you should be done!
